Project 1: Basic Sales Report Analysis
Objective: Analyze a company's sales data to calculate revenue, profits, and trends.

Dataset:
Generate a synthetic dataset (500+ rows) with columns:

Order_ID, Date, Product, Category, Quantity, Unit_Price, Region, Customer_ID


Step-by-Step Questions:
Beginner (Data Loading & Basic Calculations)
Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

Display the first 10 rows.

Check for missing values,duplicates and handle them.

Calculate total sales (Quantity * Unit_Price).

Find the average order value by product.

Group sales by Product and sort by highest revenue.

Calculate total sales per Region.

Find the best-selling product.

Calculate the profit margin (assume a fixed cost of 60% of Unit_Price).

Filter orders above $500.

Intermediate (Pivot Tables & Visualization)
Create a pivot table showing sales by Region and Category.

Plot a bar chart of monthly sales trends.

Use groupby to find the top 5 customers by spending.

Calculate the percentage of total sales per category.

Plot a pie chart of sales distribution by Region.

Advanced (Automation & Reporting)

Add a new column classifying sales as "High" (>500),"Medium"500),"Medium"(100-500),or"Low"(<500),or"Low"(<100).

Use seaborn to create a heatmap of sales correlation.

Write a function to flag outliers in Quantity.
