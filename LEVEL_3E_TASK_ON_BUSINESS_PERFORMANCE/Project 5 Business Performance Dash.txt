Project 5: Business Performance Dashboard (Multi-Source Data + AI Insights)
Objective: Build an interactive dashboard combining sales, marketing, and customer data.

Dataset:
Sales Data: Sample Superstore

Marketing Data: Google Ads Metrics

Customer Sentiment: Scrape Twitter/Reddit (using tweepy or praw)

Key Python Libraries:
Data Merging: pandas, sqlite3 (for SQL-like operations)

Visualizations:

Static: matplotlib, seaborn

Interactive: plotly, bokeh, altair

Dashboards: Dash, Streamlit

Machine Learning: scikit-learn (for predictive insights)

Step-by-Step Questions:
Beginner (Data Integration & Cleaning)
Merge sales, marketing, and sentiment data into one DataFrame.

Handle datetime conversions (e.g., Order Date vs. Campaign Date).

# Calculate delivery time (days)

Fix inconsistencies (e.g., "NY" vs. "New York" in Region).

Intermediate (Advanced Visualizations)
Plotly Express: Create a sunburst chart of Region > Category > Sales.

Bokeh: Interactive line chart of sales trends with hover tooltips.

Altair: Layered chart combining sales and customer sentiment.

Folium: Geomap of high-value customers.

Advanced (ML + Automated Reporting)
Use scikit-learn to predict sales based on ad spend (linear regression).

Apply NLP on customer sentiment (positive/negative/neutral).

Build a Streamlit dashboard with:

Dropdown filters (region, product category).

Dynamic KPI cards (total revenue, ROI).

Interactive scatter plot of Marketing Spend vs. Sales.

Schedule automated weekly reports using PythonAnywhere.

Final Challenge:
Combine Projects 4 & 5 into a single automated pipeline:

Scrape data → Clean → Merge → Analyze → Visualize → Deploy (Streamlit/Dash).

Add predictive analytics (e.g., "Next month’s sales forecast").
